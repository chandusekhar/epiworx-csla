In 2010 I convinced my employer, the [Epitec Group][1], to open source our project management software, which we called Epiworx. 

This is a rewrite of a previous version which can be found at [https://github.com/mattruma/epiworx][4]. In this version I am leveraging dependency injection for the data access layer, real unit testing and move to the Razor view enginer for ASP.NET MVC3.

I can be reached at [mattruma@gmail.com][2] or on twitter at [http://www.twitter.com/mattruma][3].

This is a full feature application based on Rockford Lhotka's CSLA framework ... so if you are looking for example of any implement of the CSLA framework, this project would be a good start.

Thanks and looking forward to seeing other developers contributions soon!
